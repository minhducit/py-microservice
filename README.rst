Opp Compute 
===========

Repository to provide functional algorithms for **OPP** use-cases. (ASML)

Introduction
-------------

This repository serves as source-code library for all the algorithms implemented to be used in White-Rabbit.
The code tries to be as generic as possible to re-use the functions amongst different algorithms.

Notes
------

Usage:

* Prefect_ - Defining flow and tasks
* Pandas_ - For computing on dataframes
* Numpy_ - For computing on numpy arrays
* Scikit-learn_ - For Machine Learning in python
* Dask_ - Distributed computing
